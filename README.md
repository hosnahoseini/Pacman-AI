> In this project, Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. Try to build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.


This contains Pac-Man projects which were adopted from UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence class, CS 188. It explores several techniques of Artificial Intelligence such as Searching, Heuristics, Adversarial Behaviour, Reinforcement Learning etc.

**Project 1: Search** - DFS, BFS, UCS, Greedy Search, A* Search


**Project 2: MultiAgent** - minimax, alpha-beta pruning, expectimax


**Project 3: Markov Decision Processes & Reinforcement Learning** - Value Iteration, Q-learning, Approximate Q-learning


**Project 4: Ghostbusters** - Hidden Markov Model, Bayes Net, Particle Filtering.


Detailed information about each of this project can be found under each project's folder.
